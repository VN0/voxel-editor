Thank you for testing this beta release. This is an incomplete version of the app. I will continue to add functionality moving towards the first finished release.
Code is availible at https://github.com/vanjac/voxel-editor. It can't be built on its own, since it's missing textures that I can't redistribute.
Please leave a review! Let me know what you think of the app, and what you would like me to change or add. Report any issues or bugs on the GitHub page above.
