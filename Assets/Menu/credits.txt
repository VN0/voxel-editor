Developed by Jacob van't Hoog.

Thank you for trying N-Space! This is a work in progress -- I will continue to make improvements and add more features.
Code is available at https://github.com/vanjac/voxel-editor. It's missing most of the textures, which I'm not permitted to redistribute.
Please leave a review! Let me know what you think of the app, and what you would like me to change or add. Report any bugs/issues on the GitHub page above.
